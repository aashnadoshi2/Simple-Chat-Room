# Simple-Chat-Room
Created a chat room on a single computer where multiple clients can chat with each other.

Things learned:
- Understand the creation of sockets
- Understand that application protocols are often simple plain text messages with special meaning
- Understand how to parse simple text commands.
- Basic socket programming to create a client-server application
- How do multiple clients connect to a single server?
- How to keep multiple persistent TCP connections alive?
- Text parsing to develop a custom application layer protocol. (This is, in spirit, very similar to how HTTP works, for example)
